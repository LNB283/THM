### Synopsis
```
Barney is setting up the ABC webserver, and trying to use TLS certs to secure connections, but he's having trouble. Here's what we know...

He was able to establish nginx on port 80,  redirecting to a custom TLS webserver on port 4040
There is a TCP socket listening with a simple service to help retrieve TLS credential files (client key & certificate)
There is another TCP (TLS) helper service listening for authorized connections using files obtained from the above service
Can you find all the Easter eggs?
